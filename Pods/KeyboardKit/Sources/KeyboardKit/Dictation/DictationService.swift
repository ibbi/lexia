/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 dictation operations.

 KeyboardKit does not have a standard service as it does for
 other services. It has a ``DisabledDictationService`` which
 can be used as a placeholder.

 KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``StandardDictationService`` that
 is then used by a ``StandardKeyboardDictationService`` that
 is also unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro. Make sure that you use
 a ``KeyboardDictationService`` to handle dictations between
 keyboard extensions and their main app.
